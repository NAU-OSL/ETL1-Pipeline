It used to be that I had to complete a zoom in  then zoom out again to find my place.  With this  I can ESC from it.  It would make sense to abort other kinds of drags too  but they might need more work.

This patch uses a cleaner TLS method and adds some race prevention. I think this covers all of the possible races that needed attention.  [The races I identified](https://gist.github.com/walisser/951929d36a998aa8b7209ebd88efdacf) in BlockFile are due to a few mutable members which control error suppression (mSilentLog/mSilentAliasLog). These can be ignored since worst that can happen is a few undesired logs are sent when project is corrupted or files go missing (correct me if I m wrong).  As Paul has pointed out  the reassignment case can race for sure  as the correction applied in CalculateOneSpectrum crosses bins.  While the probability of this is very small  I have added race prevention in the form of atomic read/update/write for the offending assignment. This uses omp atomic (not mutex) so the overhead is very low  measured at about 5%.

This means that the numbers indicating the start and the end of the labeled interval could end up using a comma as a decimal separator.  This makes the exported file less portable  especially in the case of parsing the exported file with an external tool.  Audacity is already able to _import_ labels tracks independently of the locale because it uses Internat::CompatibleToDouble()  so do something symmetric at _export_ time  using Internat::ToString() to make the exported data locale-independent (i.e. always using a dot as the decimal separator).  Proposed in https://sourceforge.net/p/audacity/mailman/message/35534945/  NOTE:  When converting numbers to strings FLT_DIG is passed as the digitsAfterDecimalPoint argument of Internat::ToString()  this is in order to preserve the look and the alignment of the previous  %f  format specifier  without that Internat::ToString() would strip trailing zeros.

I reviewed all uses of CopySamples (the function in which all dithering happens) that are not in WaveClip or Sequence.  Dithering happens only when samples are copied from a wider sample format to a narrower one.  In some cases I hide the calls in SamplesToFloats where the destination was always float  or simplify to memcpy where source was also float.  In others I give some informal proof in comments why dither will never happen  or argued that it does properly happen in one unlikely case of import of old .aup projects.  In one place I disable dithering when recording to other than floating point format  which users won t do if they keep the default format.  There are some rewrites and simplifications of widely used functions that fetch from WaveTrack  almost always as floating point format  to make the proofs easier to verify.  Finally there is some incidental review and cleanup in ImportAup.cpp.',\n",
